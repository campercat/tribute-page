      <p>
        In the US, 25.4% (source) of all households own cats, that's about 1 out
        of every 4 American households. For the families that have cats, the
        average number owned per household is 1.8 cats.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both dogs and cats are very popular options for pets, they provide us
        love and affection and many owners treat their furry friends as part of
        their family. If you ever thought about or are currently considering
        adding a cat to your family, that is great! But, before you go out to
        buy or adopt a cat (you should always choose adopting over buying), you
        should probably consider the following 5 things before jumping in.
      </p>
      <h2>1. Time</h2>
      <p>
        Taking care of any animals require a lot of time and patience. As an
        owner, you will need to spend time with your cat so he/she doesn't feel
        lonely, such as playing with them, or just "talking" to them since cats
        tend to try to communicate with their humans using meows.
      </p>
      <h2>2. Maintenance</h2>
      <p>
        Having cats means more than just daily cleaning of the litter box. The
        addition of a cat to your household is lovely and your cat will give you
        unconditional love, but you are also responsible for all the work that
        comes with it. When cats use their litter box they usually have litter
        pieces tracking on the floor, then as the owner you might want to do
        cleaning around the house more often to minimize litter on the floor.
        Cats also shed very often, so don't be surprised when your clothes, and
        beddings are covered with your cat's hair!
      </p>
      <h2>3. Cost</h2>
      <p>
        You are probably aware of the cost for buying their food, litter, and
        regular check-ups to the Vet. But that is not all! In addition to the
        essentials, cats will also need accessories such as nail clippers, toys,
        furnitures, as well as supplementary food such as vitamins and other
        health products to maintain their health. Also, do not underestimate the
        cost to the vets, the bill can easily go well over $1000 because
        sometimes your cat might need to do various exams to pin point the
        health issue, especially when the cat gets older.
      </p>

      <h2>4. Commitment</h2>
      <p>
        Cats can live up to 20 years with proper care. In the the span of time
        that you both share, will you be able to provide sufficient care and
        attention to your cat? Will you be willing to look for someone else to
        take care of your cat when you are out of town for more than a day?
      </p>
      <h2>5. Emotions</h2>
      <p>
        You bring a cat home, take proper care of the cat and you guys share
        wonder times together. Many cat owners treat their cats the same as
        family and nothing less. However, cats get sick as they age, will you be
        ready to take the emotional responsibility when they pass away?
      </p>

      <p>
        Being a pet owner means huge responsibility, but if you are up for the
        challenge, you will find yourself a funny/affectionate/adorable company
        for many years to come.
